# ShortFiction Publishing Company
This project is based on a fictional company with fictional data, primarily generated using Mockaroo.com.
The goal is to demonstrate my expertise in SQL Server through a comprehensive test case. 
The ShortFiction folder includes scripts to initialize the database, alongside the ShortFiction Publishing Company document, which provides the scenario and walkthrough,
and complete solution scripts. 
The setup script is designed to create the database, tables, and procedures if they do not already exist. 
A separate database file and filegroup have been established, and set as the default filegroup, 
to segregate user-created tables and objects from the system tables and objects that reside in the PRIMARY filegroup. 
Additionally, population scripts are provided for each table to generate the same sample data contained in this document.
